Input redirection client for the 3DS using QtGamepad.
This edition is only supported by me on Linux distros. If you are using the Android, Windows, or MacOS builds, you'll wanna use those instead. I will not fix/maintain those other versions.

Currently, multiple controller support is broken. I think it was utilizing a Windows aspect that made it not work on Linux at all.

  Build instructions:

    Dependencies:
    qt5-base
    qt5-gamepad

    qmake
    make
